# Resume PDF Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the resume PDF. In a real implementation, you would:

1. Create a professional PDF resume using tools like:
   - LaTeX with a modern template
   - Adobe InDesign or Canva
   - Google Docs or Microsoft Word exported to PDF

2. Name it `resume.pdf` and place it in the `public` folder

3. Ensure the PDF includes:
   - Contact information
   - Professional summary
   - Work experience with achievements
   - Technical skills
   - Education and certifications
   - Key projects

The download link in the resume page will serve this file to visitors.

For now, the HTML version of the resume is available on the `/resume` page.
